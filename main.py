# Task One
#
#Create a function that, given a number, returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.
#
#Examples
#fibonacci(3)= 3
#fibonacci(7) = 21
#fibonacci(12) = 233
#Notes
#The first number in the sequence starts at 1 (not 0).


def fibonacci (x) :
  #
  # Fill in your code below

  return 1


# 
# Test your code there

# print ("3rd Fibonacci number is: ", fibonacci(3))
# print ("7th Fibonacci number is: ", fibonacci(7))
# print ("12th Fibonacci number is: ", fibonacci(12))

fibtest = [3, 7, 12]
for x in fibtest :
  print (x, "th Fibanacci term is: ", fibonacci(x))


#
# Task Two
#

#Create a function which takes in a number n as input and returns all numbers up to and including n joined # together in a string. Separate each digit from each other with the character '-'.

#Examples
#join_digits(4) = '1-2-3-4'
#join_digits(11) = '1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-1-0-1-1'
#join_digits(15) = '1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-1-0-1-1-1-2-1-3-1-4-1-5'
#Notes
#Remember to start at 1 and include n as the last number.

def join_digits (x) :

  joinstring = ""
  #
  # Fill in your code below

  return joinstring


# 
# Test your code there

test = [4, 11, 15]
for x in test :
  print ("join_digit: ", x, "is: ", join_digits (x))


#
# Task 3
#

#Create a function that returns the amount of duplicate characters in a string. It will be case sensitive #and spaces are included. If there are no duplicates, return 0.
#
#Examples
#duplicates("Hello World!") = 3
#duplicates("foobar") = 1
#duplicates("helicopter") = 1
#duplicates("birthday") = 0
# If there are no duplicates, return 0

# 
# Task 4
#

#A Primorial is a product of the first n prime numbers (e.g. 2 x 3 x 5 = 30). 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 are prime #numbers. If n was 3, you'd multiply 2 x 3 x 5 = 30 or Primorial = 30.
#
#Create a function that returns the Primorial of a number.
#Examples
#primorial(1) = 2
#primorial(2) = 6
#primorial(8) = 9699690
